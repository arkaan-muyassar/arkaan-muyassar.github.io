<p>[24/02/24]</p>
<p>hi. this is ark speaking.<br>
  i have announced that i will going on a hiatus late january. forget about that, i love the internet. i will stay until this year ends or early 2025.</p>
<p>- &quot;but... what made you want to go on hiatus?&quot;</p>
<p>it's kind of hard to say. the main reason why i will go on hiatus is because i want to focus more on my education.<br />
i think this is the first time i'm sharing this piece of information publicly. i am currently thirteen years old. so all the numbers of my age i put on my social media is made up.<br />
  another reason is, i want to touch more grass. i spent my time pretty much on the internet, and i want to get some rest.</p>
<p>- &quot;when will you come back?&quot;</p>
<p>when i graduate and turn 18, which is about 4 years from now. i still check the social media sometimes, and i will watch  your awesome BMS works!</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>by the way, i created a new alias: 42SoL, which stands for &quot;Fourty-Two Sources of Light&quot;, and it is my main alias now! however, you  still can call me &quot;ark&quot;, &quot;arkaan&quot;, or &quot;muya&quot;. <br />
  i will also lead a BOF:TT team: <a href="https://arkaan-muyassar.github.io/boftt.html">&quot;-20&quot;</a>. the team focuses on reflecting BMS and BGA in 2004. if you want to join, feel free to contact me on the contact section on the bottom of the page! <br />
last thing, i know i've been inimical to everyone on social media in the past years. i was so jealous, and i regret it now. i'm so sorry for everything i've done...</p>
<p>that's it for this time, c u next post! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 </p>
