hi. this is arkaan speaking.

i was an internet addict since 2020 when i start publishing my works. in late 2021, i was thinking that those works are bad, so i managed to completely remove them from the internet.
i'm just 3 years here, that's what i'm here to announce that currently as twenty two of august 2023, i'm:



  13 years old.



some of you may not believe it, but that's normal for me.
when i was 10-11, i used to say my age publicly, but people doesn't believe me by saying things like "a fornite player cannot make works like this, where did you stole them from?".
that's when i started to faking my age by adding another 3 years to my actual age. this was because i use the num keys, so i have an excuse whenever i accidentaly leaked my actual age.
